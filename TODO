[ ] bugs:
	[ ] alpha mask with png2if | lel is always black?
	[ ] resizing slow (might be a dwm issue).
[ ] use XSHM again?
[ ] enter key or some other key should print the current filename to stdout.
[ ] for pictures which use an alpha mask use a checked pattern, similar to:

[ ] mouse support.
	[ ] mouse move panning.
	[x] mouse scroll zooming.

	[ ] use XPutPixel for byte-order safety ?
